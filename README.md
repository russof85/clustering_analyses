# Clustering analyses of omics data
Different scripts for performing clustering of omics data. Currently, a particular focus is given to LC-MS/MS untargeted metabolomics data but the approaches here can be applied to several data types. At the moment, it contains code for performing a weighted correlation network analysis using the WGCNA package, hierarchical clustering, functions to plot heatmaps and obtaining clusters using K-means.
